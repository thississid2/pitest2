# Tailwind CSS v4 Upgrade Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Updates
- ✅ Updated `tailwindcss` from `^3.4.0` to `^4.0.0` (actually installed v4.1.11)
- ✅ Removed `autoprefixer` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Removed `postcss` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Removed `postcss.config.mjs` file

### 2. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Updated `tailwind.config.ts` to remove the `plugins: []` array (v4 format)
- ✅ Updated `app/globals.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of the old `@tailwind` directives

### 3. Code Fixes
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript/ESLint error in `PiCheckout.tsx` (removed unused `selectedTemplate` variable)

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Build process works (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Development server starts (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ All Tailwind v4 dependencies installed correctly

## Key Differences in Tailwind v4

1. **No PostCSS required**: Tailwind v4 doesn't require PostCSS configuration
2. **Single import**: Uses `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of separate base/components/utilities imports
3. **Simplified config**: No need for plugins array in basic configurations
4. **Better performance**: Improved build times and smaller bundle sizes

## Hosting Readiness

The project is now ready for hosting with Tailwind v4:
- All dependencies are properly updated
- Build process is working correctly
- No compilation errors
- All Tailwind classes will work as expected

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Deploy to your hosting platform
2. Run `npm run build` to create production build
3. Use `npm start` to run the production server
4. Continue developing with all Tailwind v4 benefits

The upgrade is complete and the project is production-ready!
